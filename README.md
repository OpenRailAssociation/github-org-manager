# GitHub Organization Manager

[![REUSE status](https://api.reuse.software/badge/github.com/OpenRailAssociation/github-org-manager)](https://api.reuse.software/info/github.com/OpenRailAssociation/github-org-manager)

A lightweight tool that helps with managing a GitHub organization, its members, teams, repository permissions and more.

The basic principle: all settings reside in YAML configuration files which will be made effective during a run of this tool.

## Features

* Manage GitHub teams and their members and maintainers
* Support of sub-teams
* Manage teams' permissions on organizations' repositories
* Invite members to the organization if they aren't part of it yet
* Warn about unmanaged teams
* Warn about organization members who are not part of any team

Are you missing a feature? Please check whether it's [already posted as an issue](https://github.com/OpenRailAssociation/github-org-manager/issues), and create one of this isn't the case.

## Install

Dependencies: Python 3.10 or newer

To install: `pip3 install github-org-manager`

You may also want to consider using helpers such as [`pipx`](https://pipx.pypa.io/) to avoid a dependency mess on your system.

Afterwards, the tool is executable with the command `gh-org-mgr`. The `--help` flag informs you about the required and available commands.

## Configuration

Inside [`config/example`](./config/example), you can find an example configuration that shall help you to understand the structure:

* `app.yaml`: Configuration necessary to run this tool
* `org.yaml`: Organization-wide configuration
* `teams/*.yaml`: Configuration concerning the teams of your organization.

You may also be interested in the [live configuration of the OpenRail Association's organization](https://github.com/OpenRailAssociation/openrail-org-config).

## Run the program

You can execute the program using the command `gh-org-mgr`. `gh-org-mgr --help` shows all available arguments and options.

Some examples:

* `gh-org-mgr -c myorgconf`: synchronize the settings of the GitHub organization with your local configuration in the given configuration path (`myorgconf`). This may create new teams, remove/add members, and change permissions.
* `gh-org-mgr -c myorgconf --dry`: as above, but do not make any modification. Perfect for testing your local configuration and see its potential effects.
* `gh-org-mgr -c myorgconf --debug`: the first example, but show full debugging information.
